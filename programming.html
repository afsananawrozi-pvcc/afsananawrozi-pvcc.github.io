            long something is true. Repeat/until loop: continue looping
            until something is true. For loop: loop a givenn number of times</li>
        <li>Recursive Structure: Repeat a set of instructios as a subtask of itself.

                certain criteria. Filters: temporary search. Queries: search criteria are saved so
                they don't have to be recreated.nTwo popular search techniques:
                Sequential search: search from top to bottom or bottom to top, one item at a time.
                Binary search: only works if data is SORTED first, start in the middle, then go to half of that, etc.

                    <li>Acceptance Testing: Acceptance testing is a quality assurance (QA)
                        process that determines to what degree an application meets end users' approval.</li>
                    <li>Integration Testing: Is a type of software testing in which the different units
                        modules or components of a software application are tested as a combined entity.</li>
                    <li>Unit Testing: 
                        Unit testing is a software development process in which the smallest testable
                        parts of an application, called units, are individually scrutinized for proper operation.</li>
                    <li>Functional Testing: Functional testing is a type of testing that seeks to establish whether
                        each application feature works as per the software requirements. Each function is compared to
                        the corresponding requirement to ascertain whether its output is consistent
                        with the end user's expectations.</li>
                    <li>Performace Testing: 
                        What is performance testing and how does it work ...
                        Performance testing is a testing measure that evaluates the speed, responsiveness and
                        stability of a computer, network, software program or device under a workload.</li>
                    <li>Regression Testing: Regression testing is a type of software testing conducted after
                        a code update to ensure that the update introduced no new bugs.</li>
                    <li>Stress Testing: Stress testing is software testing used to determine how an
                        application or system behaves when under extreme levels of stress.</li>
                    <li>Usability Testing: 
                        What is Usability Testing? â€” updated 2023 | IxDF
                        Usability testing is the practice of testing how easy a design is to use with a group
                        of representative users. It usually involves observing users as they attempt to complete
                        tasks and can be done for different types of designs.</li>

                <li>Continous Testing:  It is part of a DevOps approach-where
                    development and operations collaborate over the entire product life cycle.</li>
                <li>Configuration Managment: Organizations centrally maintain test assets and track
                    what software builds to test. Teams gain access to assets such as code, requirements,
                    design documents, models, test scripts and test results.</li>
                <li>Service Virtualization: Service virtualization simulates the services and systems that
                    are missing or not yet completed, enabling teams to reduce dependencies and test sooner.
                    They can reuse, deploy and change a configuration to test different scenarios without
                    having to modify the original environment.</li>
                <li>Defect or "bug tracking": Monitoring defects is important to both testing and development
                    teams for measuring and improving quality. Automated tools allow teams to track defects,
                    measure their scope and impact, and uncover related issues.</li>
                <li>Metrics and Reporting: Reporting and analytics enable team members to share status,
                    goals and test results. Advanced tools integrate project metrics and present results in a
                    dashboard. Teams quickly see the overall health of a project and can monitor
                    relationships between test, development and other project elements.</li>
