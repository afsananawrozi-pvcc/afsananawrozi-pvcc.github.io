        </li>
    <ul>
        <li>Version control - also known as source control or revision conrtol
            - is an important software development practice for tracking and managing
            changes made to code and other files. It is closely
            related to source code management.</li>
        </ul>
        <li>What is GitHub?</li>
    <ul>
        <li>GitHub is an online software development platform. It's used for storing,

    </ul>
        <li>What is the diffrence between Git and GitHub?</li>
    <ul>Git is a version control system that lets you manage and keep track of your source code history.

            and PJ Hyett after it had been made available for a few months prior as a beta release.
            When Chris and Tom started working on GitHub in late 2007,
            Git was largely unknown as a version control system.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Git/GitHub Terms Definations</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Repository</li>

    <ul>
    <li>A Git repository is a central storage location
        for managing and tracking changes in files and directories.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Commit</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Commit is similar to saving a file that's been edited,
        a commit records changes to one or more files in your branch.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Fork</li>
    <ul>
        <li>ForkA fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with
        the original “upstream” repository. Forks are often used to iterate
        on ideas or changes before they are proposed back to the upstream repository,
        such as in open source projects or when a user does not have write access to
        the upstream repository.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Push</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Push is one of the four commands in Git that prompts interaction with the remote
            repository. You can also think of git push as update or publish. By default, git
            push only updates the corresponding branch on the remote.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Pull requests</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Pull requests let you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository
            on GitHub. Once a pull request is opened, you can discuss and review the potential 
            changes with collaborators and add follow-up commits before your changes are merged into
            the base branch.</li>   
    </ul>

        <li>Workflows</li>
    <ul>
        <li>A workflow is a configurable automated process that will run one or more jobs. Workflows 
            are defined by a YAML file checked in to your repository and will run when triggered by
            an event in your repository, or they can be triggered manually, or at a defined schedule.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Issues</li>
    <ul>
        <li>Issues let you track your work on GitHub, where development happens. 
            When you mention an issue in another issue or pull request, the issue's
            timeline reflects the cross-reference so that you can keep track of related work.
            To indicate that work is in progress, you can link an issue to a pull request.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Raw button</li>
    <ul>
        <li>With the raw view, you can view or copy the raw content of a file without any styling.</li>
    </ul>

        <li>Blame button</li>
    <ul>
        <li>The git blame command is used to examine the contents of a file line by line and see when each
            line was last modified and who the author of the modifications was.</li>
    </ul>
